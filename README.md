# RustNeuralNet
Toy example (for rust learning purposes) of a toy neural network built in Rust from absolute scratch, without external libraries.
It aims at mimicking the simple univariate function y = x^4 - 2 * x^2 by tuning the weights of a simpler y = a + b*x^2 function with a neural network. ( in the interval -2,2), minimizing RMSE as a loss function.
